To achieve the highest energy efficiency and performance we must take the expanded view
of computer architecture

## Building Blocks of Modern Computers
### Transistors
Computers are built from very large numbers of very small (and relatively simple) structures: transistors
- Intel 4004, in 1971, had 2300 MOS transistors
- Intel’s Pentium IV microprocessor, 2000, was made up of more than 42 Million MOS transistors
- Apple’s M2 Max, offered for sale in 2022, is made up of more than 67 Billion MOS transistors
### MOS Transistor
We get a Transistor by combining
- Conductors (Metal)
- Insulators (Oxide)
- Semiconductors
### Different Types of MOS Transistors
There are two types of MOS transistors: n-type and p-type
 <p align="center">
  <img src="Capture2.PNG" width="400" height="150">
</p>
  
  - **n-type**: Conducts when gate voltage = 3V.  
  - **p-type**: Conducts when gate voltage = 0V. 
  ### Transistor Works As a Switch
  Instead of the wall switch, we could use an n-type or a p-type MOS transistor to make or break the closed circuit
  - If the gate of an **n-type** transistor is supplied with a high voltage, the connection from source to drain acts like a piece of wire (i.e., the circuit is closed)
  - If the gate of the **n-type** transistor is supplied with zero voltage, the connection between the source and drain is broken (i.e., the circuit is open).

**p-type** transistor works in exactly the opposite fashion from n-type transistor
- The circuit is open when the gate is supplied with 3V
- The circuit is closed when the gate is supplied with 0V
### Logic Gates
We construct basic logical units out of individual MOS transistors. These logical units are called logic gates.
They implement simple Boolean functions.

Modern computers use both n-type and p-type transistors, i.e. Complementary MOS (CMOS) technology

</p>

### CMOS Circuit
#### Operation:
- When the input is high (1):

     PMOS is off, NMOS is on → Output is connected to GND  Output is low (0).
- When the input is low (0):

     PMOS is on, NMOS is off → Output is connected to V<sub>DD</sub> → Output is high (1).

</p>

### General CMOS Gate Structure
  
  The general form used to construct any inverting logic gate, such as: NOT, NAND, or NOR
  - The networks may consist of transistors in series or in parallel
  - When transistors are in parallel, the network is ON if one of the transistors is ON
  - When transistors are in series, the network is ON only if all transistors are ON
  - pMOS transistors are used for pull-up
  - nMOS transistors are used for pull-down

# Lecture no 2
## Logic Circuits
Build some of the logic structures that are important components of the microarchitecture of a computer
A logic circuit is composed of:
Inputs and Outputs
<p align="center">
  <img src="Capture6.PNG" width="400" height="150">
</p>
Functional specification (describes relationship between inputs and outputs)

Timing specification (describes the delay between inputs changing and outputs responding)
#### Types of Logic Circuits
- Combinational Logic:
**Memoryless**
Outputs are strictly dependent on the combination of input values that are being applied to circuit right now

- Sequential Logic: **Has memory**
Structure stores history Can ”store” data values Outputs are determined by previous (historical) and current values of inputs

**Definition:**

The **Sum of Products (SOP)** is a Boolean expression format where **two or more product (AND) terms** are **added (OR)** together.
Each product term represents a **minterm**, i.e., a unique input combination for which the output is 1.

**Example:** F = A̅·B + A·B̅ + A·B


**2. Product of Sums (POS)**
**Definition:**

The **Product of Sums (POS)** is a Boolean expression format where **two or more sum (OR) terms** are **multiplied (ANDed)** together.

Each sum term represents a **maxterm**, i.e., a unique input combination for which the output is 0.

**Example:**
F = (A + B̅) · (A̅ + C) · (B + C̅)

Exactly one of the outputs is 1 and all the rest are 0s
- The output that is logically 1 is the output corresponding to the input pattern that the logic circuit is expected to detect

##  Sequential Circuits

* **Sequential circuits** are digital circuits whose output depends **not only on current inputs but also on past inputs** (i.e., they have memory).
* They consist of **latches** and **flip-flops** which store bits.


##  RS Latch (Basic Latch)

###  What is RS Latch?

* An **RS Latch** is a basic **bistable memory device** with two inputs:

  * **R (Reset)**
  * **S (Set)**
* It has two outputs:

  * **Q** (normal output)
  * **Q'** (complement output)


###  Operation of RS Latch:

| S | R | Q (Next State) | Description          |
| - | - | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 0 | 0 | Q (No change)  | Hold previous state  |
| 0 | 1 | 0              | Reset state          |
| 1 | 0 | 1              | Set state            |
| 1 | 1 | Invalid        | Forbidden (unstable) |

 Circuit:

* Usually made from **two cross-coupled NOR gates** (or NAND gates for active low inputs).
* The outputs feed back to inputs to maintain state.



## How to Make a Gated D Latch from RS Latch

### Goal:

* Create a **D latch** that stores the input data **D** only when the **Enable (EN)** signal is active.
* Use the **RS latch** as the basic memory element, and control inputs S and R from D and EN.


Step 1: Understand the D Latch Inputs

* Input **D** (data)
* Input **EN** (enable)

Step 2: Connect D and EN to RS Inputs

* We want **S** and **R** controlled so that:

  * When **EN = 1**, the latch follows **D**
  * When **EN = 0**, the latch **holds** the previous state (no change)


Step 3: Generate S and R signals from D and EN

| EN | D | S (Set) | R (Reset) |                    |
| -- | - | ------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| 0  | X | 0       | 0         | (Hold state)       |
| 1  | 0 | 0       | 1         | (Reset latch to 0) |
| 1  | 1 | 1       | 0         | (Set latch to 1)   |

Step 4: Logic for S and R:

* **S = D AND EN**
* **R = (NOT D) AND EN**

Step 5: Final Circuit 

* Inputs **D** and **EN** go through gates to produce **S** and **R** inputs for the RS latch.
* RS latch stores the value based on S and R inputs.
* When **EN = 0**, S = R = 0, so latch holds its state.
* When **EN = 1**, latch updates Q to D.



| EN | D | S = D·EN | R = EN·D' | Output Behavior     |
| -- | - | -------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| 0  | X | 0        | 0         | Hold previous state |
| 1  | 0 | 0        | 1         | Reset output to 0   |
| 1  | 1 | 1        | 0         | Set output to 1     |

Absolutely, Nimra! Here’s a polished and well-structured explanation for **Register using D Latches**:

---

# Register 

### What is a Register?

A **register** is a digital storage device composed of multiple flip-flops or latches used to store binary data. It stores multiple bits of information simultaneously and is widely used in CPUs, memory units, and digital systems.

---

### Using D Latches to Build a Register

A **D latch** is a basic memory element that stores a single bit when enabled. By combining several D latches in parallel, you can build a register that stores multiple bits.


### How It Works:

* Each **D latch** stores one bit of data.
* All latches share a common **Enable (EN)** signal.
* When **EN = 1 (enabled)**, the latch is **transparent** — the output **Q** follows the input **D**.
* When **EN = 0 (disabled)**, the latch **holds** (stores) the last value at its output **Q**.
* By applying the **Enable signal simultaneously** to all latches, the register stores the entire multi-bit word in parallel.



### Operation Table (for each D latch)

| Enable (EN) | Input (D)      | Output Q (Next State)       |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 0           | X (don’t care) | Holds previous output value |
| 1           | 0              | Output Q = 0 (follows D)    |
| 1           | 1              | Output Q = 1 (follows D)    |

# Flip-Flop 

* A **flip-flop** is like a latch but **edge-triggered**: it changes its output only on a **specific clock edge** (rising or falling).
* This makes flip-flops very important in synchronous digital circuits, where all elements update their outputs simultaneously on clock edges.
* A **D flip-flop** stores the input data only at the moment of the clock edge (e.g., rising edge).

Building a Flip-Flop from D Latches 

* A common way to make an edge-triggered D flip-flop from level-sensitive latches is to use **two gated D latches in series**:

  * **Master latch** (enabled when CLK=0)
  * **Slave latch** (enabled when CLK=1)
* How it works:

  * When CLK=0, Master latch is transparent and follows input D; Slave latch holds previous data.
  * When CLK changes to 1, Master latch holds last input, Slave latch becomes transparent and takes data from Master latch — output updates only on clock edge.




##  Using D Flip-Flops to Build Memory

* Since 1 D flip-flop stores 1 bit, multiple D flip-flops can store multiple bits.
* For example, an **8-bit memory cell** uses 8 D flip-flops — each storing 1 bit.
* This group of flip-flops is called a **register**.


| Signal      | Purpose                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| D (Data In) | Input data to be stored       |
| CLK         | Clock signal controls storing |
| Q (Output)  | Stored data output            |

### Operation:

* When the clock signal **rises**, the D flip-flop stores the value of D.
* The stored value is held at Q until the next clock edge.


## Writing Data into Memory

* To **write** data, provide the input bits on D lines.
* Pulse the clock (CLK) to store the data into the flip-flops.
* The flip-flops latch the data on the clock edge.

##  Reading Data from Memory

* The stored data appears at the **Q outputs** of the flip-flops.
* Reading is just accessing these outputs.
* Since D flip-flops store data, the outputs continuously reflect stored bits.

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **State Register**   | Stores the current state of the FSM (memory element).                                     |
| **Next-State Logic** | Combinational logic that determines the next state based on the current state and inputs. |
| **Output Logic**     | Generates outputs based on the state and inputs:                                          |
|                      | - **Moore Machine:** Output depends **only on current state**.                            |
|                      | - **Mealy Machine:** Output depends on **current state and inputs**.                      |

### **Design Steps for FSM:**

1. **Define States**
   Identify all the distinct conditions or states your system can be in.

2. **Encode States**
   Assign binary codes (e.g., 2-bit, 3-bit) to each state for implementation in hardware.

3. **Create Logic**

   * Develop next-state logic using current state and inputs to determine the next state.
   * Design output logic based on whether it's a Moore or Mealy FSM.

### Summary Table:

| FSM Part         | Role                          | Depends On                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| State Register   | Stores current state (memory) | Previous state and clock      |
| Next-State Logic | Computes next state           | Current state and inputs      |
| Output Logic     | Produces output signals       | Moore: current state only     |
|                  |                               | Mealy: current state + inputs |



### Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) & Verilog

---

## What are HDLs?

* Languages to **describe hardware structure and behavior**.
* Allow **simulation** (functional and timing).
* Enable **synthesis**: generate actual hardware (gates, wiring) from high-level code.



## Why Use HDLs?

* Model **hardware parallelism** naturally.
* Manage complexity with **module hierarchy**.
* Easier to **design, simulate, verify** complex circuits.

---

## Design Methodologies

| Type      | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Top-Down  | Start from high-level, break down modules to gates. |
| Bottom-Up | Start with gates, build up to modules.              |



## Two Main HDL Styles

| Style      | Description                                      | Examples                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Structural | Describe hardware connections (gates, modules).  | Instantiate gates (`and`, `or`, `not`). |
| Behavioral | Describe circuit behavior using procedural code. | `assign`, `always`, `if`, `case`.       |



## Basic Verilog Syntax

* Case-sensitive.
* Names **cannot start with numbers**.
* Whitespaces ignored.
* Comments: `// single line`, `/* multi-line */`.

# Lecture no 5
## Bit Slicing, Concatenation & Duplication

```verilog
// Define a bus
wire [15:0] longbus;

// Slicing (extract bits 12 to 5)
wire [7:0] shortbus = longbus[12:5];

// Concatenation
assign y = {a[2], a[1], a[0]};

// Duplication
assign y = {a[0], a[0]};
```

---

## How to Express Numbers

* Format: `N'Bxx`
* `N` = number of bits, `B` = base (b=bin, d=dec, h=hex), `xx` = value
  Example:

```verilog
4'b1010  // 4-bit binary 1010
8'hFF    // 8-bit hex FF
```

---

## Conditional Assignments

```verilog
assign y = s ? d1 : d0;  // if s=1 then y=d1 else y=d0
```

---

## Operator Precedence

* Use parentheses for clarity.
* Example: `y = (a & b) | c;`

---

## Example: Comparing Two Numbers

```verilog
assign greater = (a > b);
```

---

## Parameterized Modules

```verilog
module example #(parameter WIDTH = 8) (
    input [WIDTH-1:0] a,
    output [WIDTH-1:0] y
);
// module body
endmodule

// Instantiation with parameter override
example #(16) inst1 (.a(data_in), .y(data_out));
```

---

## Timing (Simulation Only)

```verilog
#10 a = 1;  // Wait 10 time units then assign a = 1
```


## Sequential Logic in Verilog

* Use `always` block with `posedge` or `negedge` of clock.
* Use **non-blocking assignments (`<=`)** for sequential logic.
* Use synchronous or asynchronous resets.
* Example: D Flip-Flop with reset and enable:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
        q <= 0;
    else if (enable)
        q <= d;
end
```

* Use `always @*` for combinational logic.

## Difference Between Combinational and Sequential Logic

| Feature           | Combinational             | Sequential                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Memory            | No                        | Yes (stores past input/state) |
| Clock dependency  | No                        | Yes (triggered on clock edge) |
| Sensitivity list  | `always @(*)` or `assign` | `always @(posedge clk)`       |
| Assignment style  | Blocking (`=`) or assign  | Non-blocking (`<=`)           |
| Output depends on | Current inputs only       | Current inputs + past states  |
| Example use       | Logic gates, adders, MUX  | Flip-flops, registers, FSMs   |

---

## Writing Sequential Circuits: Finite State Machines (FSM)

* Use `case` statements inside `always @(posedge clk)` block.
* Keep state variables and outputs in registers.

---

## Timing and Verification

* Simulation checks **functional correctness** and **timing** before hardware fabrication.
* Verification ensures design meets specs.

---

## Circuit Design Trade-Offs

| Factor      | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Area        | Size of the circuit (number of gates)  |
| Speed       | How fast it operates (clock frequency) |
| Power       | Energy consumption                     |
| Design Time | Development time                       |

# Simple D Flip-Flop in Verilog

```verilog
module d_flip_flop (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
        q <= 0;
    else
        q <= d;
end

endmodule
```


###  **1. Timescale Directive**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
```

* `1ns`: **Time unit** used in delays (like `#5` = 5ns).
* `1ps`: **Time precision** of the simulation.

---

###  **2. Verilog Module with #5 Delay**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module and_gate_with_delay (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output reg y
);

    always @ (a or b) begin
        #5 y = a & b; // y is updated 5ns after inputs change
    end

endmodule
```
# Lecture no 6


 ## Combinational Circuit Timing

In purely combinational circuits (no memory elements), output depends only on current input.

#### **Types of Delay:**

| Delay Type                               | Meaning                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contamination Delay (t<sub>cd</sub>)** | Minimum delay from input to any output change. "Earliest effect."          |
| **Propagation Delay (t<sub>pd</sub>)**   | Maximum delay from input to output becoming valid/stable. "Latest effect." |

 **Glitches**

* Caused when different paths have different delays.
* Often harmless if final output settles correctly.

**Critical Path**

* The longest logic path from input to output.
* Determines **maximum clock frequency** in sequential circuits.

---

###  Sequential Circuit Timing

Sequential circuits include **flip-flops** or **latches** and require clocking.

#### **Key Timing Parameters:**

| Parameter                                | Meaning                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Time (t<sub>setup</sub>)**       | Input **must be stable before** clock edge (data ready).  |
| **Hold Time (t<sub>hold</sub>)**         | Input **must stay stable after** clock edge.              |
| **Clock-to-Q Delay (t<sub>clk→Q</sub>)** | Time for flip-flop to update its output after clock edge. |
| **Clock Skew**                           | Delay difference in clock arrival at two flip-flops.      |


### Timing Violations & Fixes

| Violation           | Cause                                  | Fix                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Violation** | Path too slow. Data not ready in time. |  Reduce clock freq<br>Optimize logic<br> Add pipeline stages |
| **Hold Violation**  | Path too fast. Data changes too early. |  Add delay buffers<br>Avoid fast combinational paths          |

---

###  **. Circuit Verification**

| Type                          | What It Does                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Functional Verification**   | Ensure logic does what it's supposed to. Use testbenches.                |
| **Timing Verification**       | Includes simulation **with delays**, or **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** |
| **Post-Synthesis Simulation** | Simulate gate-level delays after synthesis. More accurate.               |
| **Formal Verification**       | Use mathematical checks (e.g., **SystemVerilog Assertions**)             |

---

### **Verilog Simulation Example**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module simple_and (input a, input b, output y);
    assign #3 y = a & b; // propagation delay of 3ns
endmodule
```

**Simulation Interpretation:**

* Input changes → Wait 3ns → Output changes
* Use `#` delay for **propagation modeling only**, not synthesis.
